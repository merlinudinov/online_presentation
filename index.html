## a small preface
Since the focus of the assignment is put more on evaluating the statistical analysis part, it is not really necessary (for the audience) to know what each group in a specific experiment stands for. We need to care only about that certain groups (tags) are under **COMPARISON**.

###Hence, if you happen to open my presentation to finish your commenting assignment, **RUN!** They have too many details!
---
#1. Introduction
The main focus of the article is to examine via experiments the **learnability** of long-distance phenomena.

More specifically, the study is designed to research on **Opacity** and **Transparency** in vowel harmony process.

The whole design is on a artificially designed language where there is manipulated **Opacity** and **Transparency**. The participants are first trained on them, and they are tested whether they acquired.

This study uses *generalised linear mixed model (GLM)* to fit the data, where the dependent variable is a continuous factor. This factor is 'score-like' and is obtained after the 'test' mentioned above.

---
#1. Introduction
## Crucial Term Definitions
### (non)adjacency
If we have a sequence of `\(C_1V_1C_2V_2C_3V_3\)`, where C stands for a consonant, and V stands for a vowel;

Then, `\(C_1\)` and `\(V_1\)` are adjacent, `\(C_1\)` and `\(C_2\)` are not.

Yet, if we separate vowels and consonants into two layers, namely `\(C_1C_2C_3\)` (consonant tier) and `\(V_1V_2V_3\)` (vowel tier), then `\(C_1\)` is now adjacent to `\(C_2\)`.

### nonadjacent dependency
Two nonadjacent segments are related somehow. For instance, `\(V_2\)`'s feature depends on `\(V_1\)`'s feature, but they are not adjacent (`\(C_1\)` intervened).
---
#1. Introduction
## Crucial Term Definitions
###**first-order nonAdjacent dependency**
In the whole sequence, `\(C_1\)` intervenes between `\(V_1\)` and `\(V_2\)`. but in the vowel tier, `\(V_1\)` and `\(V_2\)` are actually adjacent. Then, if `\(V_1\)` and `\(V_2\)` are of dependency relation, then this is first-order, because only consonants intervene between them. **Opacity** is considered to be a first-order nonAdjacent dependency.
###**second-order nonAdjacent dependency**
Yet, if we look at `\(V_1\)` and `\(V_3\)`, they are not adjacent even in the vowel tier, so the intervening segments containing both consonants and vowels, then this is second-order. **Transparency** is considered to be a second-order nonAdjacent dependency.
---
#2. Research Questions
Previous studies have shown that adult learners are adept at acquiring the first-order nonadjacent dependencies in vowel harmony (Finley &amp; Badecker 2007, 2009, 2012, Moreton 2008, Pycha et al 2003).

This article focus more on the learnability of **Transparency** (second-order nonadjacent dependency), which is considered more complex and harder to learn compared to the first-order nonadjacent dependency.

### research questions [summarised by Merlin]
1. Is second-order nonadjacent dependency learnable?

2. If second-order nonadjacent dependency, namely **Transparency** in vowel harmony in this article, is harder to learn, compared to the first-order nonadjacent dependency?

3. If it is harder, is there any way to enhance the learnability?
---
#2. Research Questions
### related hypotheses
`\(H_0\)`: There is **no difference** between learnings of opaque neutral vowels (first-order nonadjacency) and transparent neutral vowels (second-order nonadjacency).

`\(H_1\)`: opaque neutral vowels (first-order nonadjacency) is **easier** to learn **than** transparent neutral vowels (second-order nonadjacency).
---
#3. Methods Summary
- Artificial grammar learning paradigm: to test hypotheses. [This is more like a simplified language model, because too many factors need to be cared about in a real language.] Artificial grammar allows us the change one single point at one step.
  - training the participant on the patterns
  - testing the participant on the patterns
  - generalised linear mixed model fit as the 'score' that participants gets in the testing period being the dependent variable.

- two-alternative forced-choice: basically, after training, there are two choices (the right one and the wrong one), the participant has to pick one. Picking the right one at the testing stage means the participant learnt the pattern.

---
#3. Methods Summary
### tags for slides purpose (training)
#### **HSH** - harmonic **stem** (harmonising vowel: i, e, o, u)
#### **HSN** - harmonic **stem** (neutral vowel: i, e, ɛ)
#### **DSN** - disharmonic **stem** (neutral vowel: o, u, ɛ)
#### **TS** - transparent **suffix**
#### **OS** - opaque **suffix**


### combination: stem + suffix

---
#3. Methods Summary
### tags for slides purpose (testing)
#### **OLD** - all combination in training
#### **newHS** - combination of new HS (new HSH/HSN) and TS/OS
#### **newDS** - combination of new DSN and TS/OS

mainly the idea is that the participant trained on combination listed on the last page and they were tested on learnt/unlearnt combinations and got a score. The test is to pick the 'right' one in two choices.

#4. Experiment I
## Interim Summary
- people can learn **T**ransparency and **O**pacity in general


- newDS is only learnt in group **O**, not in group **T**

___
*This difference between the Opaque and Transparent conditions may have increased the difficulty of learning the behavior of the transparent neutral vowel.*


---
#4. Experiment II
I will skip explaining this experiment and you will know why.

So the **second experiment** was established based on the first experiment. The researcher suspected that the significant difference tested in the **first experiment** was because **newDS** in group **T** has two possibilities, while in group **O** it has only one possibility.

They want to eliminate that it is not because of the difference between those **TWO** possibilities in group **T** that causes the difference between group **T** and group **O**.

*THEN WHY THE H**L DID YOU DESIGN THEM UNCONTROLLED IN THE FIRST PLACE!*

The results shows that the difference between group **T** and group **O** is NOT due two those two possibilites.

---
#4. Experiment III
##**Methods**
Now that we know learning **T**ransparency (Group **T**) is possible comparing to the Group **C** in general.

Yet, for **newDS** (a specific type in each group), there is no difference on 'score' if we compare group **T** and group **C**.

Then how about we change the **stem** final [ɛ] to another transparent vowel [i]? (This is a change inside all possible stems both in training and testing.) More specifically, will a different vowel lead to different score for **newDS** in group **T** comparing to group **C**?

| Group | training | testing |
|-------|---------:|--------:|
| **T**(ransparency) | HSH+TS, HSN+TS, DSN+TS| OLD, newHS, newDS |
| **C**(ontrol) | HSH, HSN, DSN | OLD, newHS, newDS |

remember here: there is a vowel change in all tags here. We might want to call for exmaple a newDS a new-newDS. Let's just do not do it...

**their description:** *a significant difference between the Transparent and Control conditions (ß = 0.81, z = 3.12, p = 0.018). - a significant interaction between the Transparent and Control conditions for new disharmonic stem vs. old stem items (ß= -0.62, z = -2.09, p = 0.037)*
---
#4. Experiment III
##**Results**

Changing the vowel inside the stem would not enhance the score (learning) of **T**ransparency.

Now, it is time to suspect if this *being unable to learn **T**ransparency* is due to a lack of training and we have three experiments in experiment 4.

Yet, we have different amount of training (exposure).

## Overall Results
Comparing to experiment **3**, participants in experiment **4c** got the highest score. 

But we are not sure whether this raising on score is due to participant variations or because we gave the participants higher amount of training...

**their description:** *a significant difference between the Transparent and the Control conditions (0.83 vs. 0.48, ß = 2.77, z = 6.12, p &lt; 0.001) - a **marginally**??? significant interaction between new disharmonic stem vs. old stem items and the training conditions (ß = -0.98, z = -1.73, p = 0.084)*

---
#4. Experiment V
##**Results**
The results of experiment 5 mirror the results of experiment 4c: participants were able to learn the behavior of the transparent neutral vowel with increased training.

I actually do not know how they get to this conclusion. If we are not sure about 4c's results as we have mentioned, and we say 5 mirrors 4c, then how do we come to this conclusion?
---
#5. Conclusion
1. Learners are able to learn **O**pacity and **T**ransparency (exp.1);

2. They are not good at generalising learnt **T**ransparency to unseen cases (exp.1);

3. Above incapacity is not affected by the quality of vowels (exp.3);

4. Increasing the amount of training could enhance their generalising ability or overall learnability of **T**ransparency (exp.4);

5. Vowel quality again is not affected by what is described in 4 (exp.5).
---
#6. Evaluations
##6.1 Explanation of analysis
### What did they do?
They applied artificial grammar learning paradigm to study on the learnability of a second-order nonadjacent dependency, namely, the **transparency** in vowel harmony.

### How did they do?
They start by testing whether **transparency** is learnable or not. After proving it is learnable, they started assuming that it is harder to learn compared to **opacity**. At last, they examined possible factors that could cause this state of being harder to learn.
---
#6. Evaluations
##6.1 Explanation of analysis
### Why did they do?
Previous studies have shown that adult learners are adept at acquiring the first-order nonadjacent dependencies in vowel harmony (Finley &amp; Badecker 2007, 2009, 2012, Moreton 2008, Pycha et al 2003). So it is necessary to **investigate as well the learnability of second-order nonadjacent dependencies**.
---
#6. Evaluations
##6.2 Appropriateness/novelty of analysis
###Given what you know/what you have previously read, was this the best analysis?
I actually do not know whether this analysis is new, because I focus more on another branch of learnability, which is totally different from experimental methods. Yet, I think there analyses work, it really is something I want to know more about.
###Did they do something you haven’t seen before? What? Why? How?
They have considered factors that theoretical methods do not consider. For example the amount of training can be tested in an experimental methods, but in theoretical way, this factor seems to be assumed as natural and gradual acquiring of certain amount of learning data.
---
#6. Evaluations
##6.3 Presentation of results
###Did they properly/accurately explain their results?
They **partially** did. Every required testing results were clarified, except on the exact change of number. In other words, they only say the tested value is significant or not, but they do not explain how the dependent variable in/decrease according to the change on independent variables.
###Did they properly/accurately interpret their findings?
They did, **perhaps**. They have given proper interpretations in terms of their analyses, but I cannot decided if those interpretations are correct.
---
#6. Evaluations
##6.3 Presentation of results
###Did they use tables/graphs? Did the tables/graphs facilitate the interpretation of the results?
They used **a lot of** tables. Most data or value needed for the interpretation are there, but they lack factors like McFadden’s `\(R^2\)` to tell us about how well is the model fit to their data.
---
#6. Evaluations
##6.4 Overall evalutations
###Briefly describe why/what you liked or disliked about their analysis
I like the way they do experiments and statistic analyses, that part is awesome!

Yet, I really hate their organisation of the paper, especially the organisation of the tables and graphs. Also, I think they wanted to do too much stuff in a single study.
